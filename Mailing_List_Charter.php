                                <p style="text-align:justify">The bdNOG mailing list is established to provide a forum for the exchange of technical information and the discussion of technical issues that require cooperation among network operators and engineers. The discussion of technically focused operational issues, and the discussion of technical issues relating to provision of Internet services and the various infrastructure related services in the telecommunications industry.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">This is NOT a forum for people to discuss any political issues, sell or advertise products, end-users to pester their service provider, or any special interest group people to promote their activities. Such behavioural post will be removed from the list and blocked for future post.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">When you post to the bdNOG mailing list any posting made should be considered as solely being the views of the person making the posting and not representing any company unless explicitly stated otherwise. You must also remember that any posting made joins the public domain and is publicly archived, it is unwise to include any information that would normally require a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) of any sort. The responsibility of this vests with the poster not the bdNOG forum.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Professional respect:</b>
                                    <br> As a list subscriber, you are required to respect the opinion of others, even if you disagree with it. Healthy debate on a topic is good, however personal attacks, name and shame attempts, or flaming will not be accepted.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">It would be worthwhile for new list subscribers to become familiar with the posters on the list before start posting. Some of the list members have spent many years in their field and are experts.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">Their experience is a resource to be valued. Also remember that there isn’t always a direct correlation between the number of posts by a poster and their expertise level.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">Remember that when you post mail to the bdNOG mailing list, your post will be received by hundreds, or even thousands, of your current and potential peers, customers, suppliers and employers. Think before posting – you don’t want to look foolish in front of these people as these are the very people you may need to ask for a job, or a favour, one day.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">We ask that list subscribers refrain from using derogatory language towards individuals, companies, or products.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Posting:</b>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Don’t quote 50 lines of text and add one line to it. Quote what is necessary to maintain context, but don’t overdo it;</li>
                                    <li>Keep your signatures and disclaimers short. It’s no fun seeing signatures that are longer than your posts;</li>
                                    <li>Cross posting to multiple lists is discouraged;</li>
                                    <li>Please don’t post in HTML format – it tends to annoy people who read with text mode clients.</li>

                                <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Attachments:</b>
                                    <br> Please don’t. Strongly discouraged. If needed provide URL so interested list member can visit the URL.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Auto-responders:</b>
                                    <br> Please make sure that if you do use an auto-responder, it’s configured to not auto-respond to list e-mail. If it does, your list membership will, in all probability, be suspended until it’s fixed.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Moderation:</b>
                                    <br> The bdNOG mailing list is reactively moderated – that is to say that posts will be delivered to members immediately, but if the moderators see the list being abused the abuser(s) will be asked to refrain from their activities. If the abuser(s) does not cease, their list subscription will be set to moderated mode, requiring all future posts to be moderator approved. Further inappropriate activity may result in the list member being removed. The bdNOG board reserve the right to remove posts from the archive that do not follow this charter.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">If the board believes a thread does not follow this charter, the board may request that no more posts to the thread be sent. It is expected that all subscribers follow this direction.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">The moderation is an undertaking of the bdNOG Board of Executive Committee. Moderators may be appointed at the Board’s choosing. bdNOG and its Executive Committee and associates accept no liability for the events, ramifications, content, or intent of any posting made to the bdNOG mailing list, nor accept liability for the moderation of a poster, removal of a post from archives, removal of posting privileges, or the removal of subscription rights.
                                </p>
